## Forecasting Competition

In this competition we'll be forecasting the total water availability across four major reservoirs in Chennai.

Data is provided on water availability in each of the four major reservoirs for the period 2004-2018. The data
is available on a daily basis and the unit is million cubic feet.

An additional data set is provided with daily rainfall (in mm) in each of the four regions for the period 2004-2018.


### Objective

**Forecast the total water availability across the four reservoirs for every day in 2019 ** 

Prepare a `predictions.csv` file with the following format:

Date, Total Water    
2019-01-01, 100.0   
2019-01-02, 102.0  
2019-01-03, 107.0  
...

We'll evaluate the forecast accuracy on the true held-out test set using the four metrics outlined
in the textbook: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, MASE.
